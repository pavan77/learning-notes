charles proxy(http requests) , wireshark(tcp packets)

rpc

two generals problem -> honest generals but unreliable messengers


byzantine general problem -> reliable message, but corrupt generals

   network -> reliable(perfect links), fair loss(packets will be dropped but on retry will succeed)
    system -> crash-stop(device gone forever), crash-recovery(node comes up), byzantine nodes()
